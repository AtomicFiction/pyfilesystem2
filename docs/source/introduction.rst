Introduction
============

PyFilesystem is a Python module that provides a common interface to any
filesystem.

Think of PyFilesystem ``FS`` objects as the next logical step to
Python's ``file`` objects. In the same way that file objects abstract a
single file, FS objects abstract an entire filesystem.


Installing
----------

You can install PyFilesystem with ``pip`` as follows::

    pip install fs

Or to upgrade to the most recent version::

    pip install fs --upgrade


You should now have the ``fs`` module on your path (version number may
vary)::

    >>> import fs
    >>> fs.__version__
    '2.0.0'
